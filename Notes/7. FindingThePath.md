1. What are the various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples.


The first way to add images in our app using `CDN link`.

```javascript
Example:
<!-- <img src = "https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/bird-colorful-logo-gradient-vector_343694-1369.jpg"/> -->
```

The second way to add images in our app using `import`.

```javascript
Example:
import {logo} from ".Images/logo.png";

function Header(){
  return(
    <>
    <img src = {logo} />
    </>
  )
}

```

Firstly, in this we will store our image in any folder and then we will import that images via folder structure.
The good way of structuring of image folder is "assets/Images/logo.png"

2. What would happened if we do `console.log(useState())`?

If we do `console.log(useState())`, we get an `array [undefined, function]` the first item is an array is state variable is undefined and the second item is an array is function which is setState function. This function through we can change the value of state variable.

3. How will `useEffect` behave if we don't add a dependency array?

If we don't add a dependency array then the useEffect Hook will be called everytime after the component is rendered.

4. What is `SPA`?

A single page application works in the browser while they don't require any page reload and extra waiting time. As we change the routes only the components are changed on a single page instead of refreshing the whole page.

Advantages of SPA :

- Provide better user experience
- Increase efficiency (smooth navigation)
- Fast and responsive

Some sites that use Single Page Application are :

- Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Google Drive, Uber, Paypal, Skype, GoogleMaps, Pinterest.

5. What is the difference between `client side` and `server side routing` (`CSR vs SSR`)?

Client-side routing and server-side routing are two different approaches to handling the navigation and rendering of web pages in web applications. They involve how the routing decisions are made and executed, and they have some key differences:

## Client-side routing:

1.  `Routing logic on the client`: In client-side routing, the routing logic is handled by the web browser on the client-side (i.e., the user's device). When a user clicks on a link or tries to navigate to a different page, the browser updates the URL and uses JavaScript to determine what content to load and display without making a request to the server.

2.  `Asynchronous loading`: With client-side routing, when users navigate between pages, only the necessary content is loaded asynchronously, typically without refreshing the entire page. This leads to faster and smoother transitions between pages and a more dynamic user experience.

3.  `Single-page applications (SPAs)`: Client-side routing is commonly used in SPAs, where the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are loaded once, and subsequent page changes are managed by JavaScript, often by using libraries or frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.

4.` Better user experience`: Client-side routing allows for quick and seamless page transitions, making the user experience feel more like using a native application.

## Server-side routing:

1.  `Routing logic on the server`: In server-side routing, the routing logic is handled on the server. When a user clicks on a link or tries to navigate to a different page, a request is sent to the server, which determines what content to generate and sends back a new HTML page that the browser then displays.

2.  `Full-page reloads`: Server-side routing often involves full-page reloads for each navigation, as the server sends the entire HTML page in response to each request. This can lead to slower page transitions and a less dynamic user experience compared to client-side routing.

3.  `Traditional web applications`: Server-side routing is the traditional approach used in many web applications, where each page request results in a full round-trip to the server for content generation.

4.  `Search engine optimization (SEO)`: Server-side routing can be advantageous for SEO since search engine bots can easily crawl and index the individual HTML pages. However, with modern advancements in client-side routing and search engine algorithms, this difference has become less significant.

```javascript
 In server side routing when navigating a whole document is served to the user. It will request a new page from the server. It causes the whole page to refresh.

In client side route happens when the route is handled internally by the javascript that is loaded on the page.
When a user clicks on a link, the URL changes but the request to the server is prevented. The whole page won't refresh when using client-side routing.

```

 _Example_

 To illustrate the difference, let's consider a simple example of navigating from the homepage to a "Contact Us" page:

 ## Client-side routing flow:

1. User clicks on the "Contact Us" link.
2. The client-side router (JavaScript-based) intercepts the click event and updates the URL without causing a full page reload.
3. The client-side router fetches the necessary content for the "Contact Us" page (usually in JSON or other data format) from the server via an API request.
4. The client-side router uses the fetched data to update the content on the page without reloading the entire page.


## Server-side routing flow:

1. User clicks on the "Contact Us" link.
2. The browser sends a request to the server for the "Contact Us" page.
3. The server processes the request, generates the entire HTML page (including the "Contact Us" content), and sends it back to the browser.
4. The browser reloads the entire page with the new content.

The key takeaway is that `client-side routing allows for a faster and more responsive user experience after the initial page load`, as subsequent page changes involve fetching and rendering only the necessary content on the client-side.

 On the other hand, `server-side routing often leads to full-page reloads for each navigation, resulting in a less dynamic and potentially slower user experience`.
