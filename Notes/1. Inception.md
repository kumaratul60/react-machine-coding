1. What is `Emmet` ?

   - Emmet is a utility library for generating HTML and XML, React from JavaScript.It makes easy to create reusable components.

2. Difference between `library` and `framework` ?

- Library: Library is a collection of reusable code along with the pre-defined helper functions, objects, classes, modules that can
  be used in code.

  Example: React, ReactDOM react-router-dom, express, Lodash, etc.

- Framework: Framework is a set of reusable code and a set of conventions for developing software.

  Example: NodeJS, Next JS, Angular etc.

The key difference between a library and a framework is => `“Inversion of Control”`.

    When calling a method from a library, the developer is in control. With a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls
    the developer's code.

3. What is `JavaScript`?

- Javascript is a dynamic typed, high-level, loosely-coupled, object oriented, prototype-based, Synchronous, Single threaded language.

- JavaScript follows functional & Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm mostly.

4. What is `React` ?

   React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React was created by Facebook in 2013. React is known for its
   simplicity, reactivity, reusability and comparability.

5. What is crossorigin in `script tag` ?

   The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.

   When you use the crossorigin attribute in a script tag, you're telling the browser to allow the script to run from a different
   domain than the page itself. This is useful if you want to run a script from a different domain than the one where the page is
   hosted.

   Setting the attribute name to an empty value, like crossorigin or crossorigin="" , is the same as anonymous .

   ```
   <script crossorigin src="app.js"></script>
   <script crossorigin="" src="app.js"></script>
   <script crossorigin="anonymous or xyz" src="app.js"></script>
   ```

   Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.

   A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

   `CORS` is used to manage cross-origin requests.

6. What is difference between `React` and `ReactDOM`?

   React is a library for building user interfaces
   ReactDOM is a library for rendering React components into HTML. It contains DOM manipulation utilities.

- - Why separate both in form of React and ReactDOM?

The reason React and ReactDOM were split into two libraries was due to the arrival of React Native (A react platform for mobile
development).

React components are such a great way to organize UI that it has now spread to mobile to react is used in web and in mobile. react-
dom is used only in web apps.

7. What is the difference between `react.production.js` and `react.development.js` ?

   react.production.js - production code that is minified and use in production environments.

some use-case for react.production:

=> It has separate bundle files for app and vendor instead of a single bundle file

=> Minification and compression of javascript and HTML resources to reduce the size of a file.

=> Source Map can be disabled at runtime to reduce the size of the code.

=> Also, Gzipping code to compress and reduce the size.

react.development.js - More readable and developer friendly code that can be used to debug,manipulation of code in development or
staging environments.

8.  What is `async` and `defer` in JS ?

    async and defer are two keywords in JavaScript that allow you to create functions that run asynchronously.

    defer => defer is used for scripts that need the whole DOM and/or their relative execution order is important.

    async => async is used for independent scripts, like counters or ads,and their relative execution order does not matter.

    async executes as soon as possible while defer runs in sequence toward the end of the loading process, just before the
    DOMContentLoaded event.

    async:

    1. async is used for independent scripts
    2. Downloads in the background at a low priority (same as defer)
    3. Can interrupt
       page rendering to execute 4. Executes as soon as possible and in no particular order

    => async is best for very high priority JavaScript resources that should run as early as possible in the loading process.

    defer:

    1.  Downloads in the background at a low priority (same as async)
    2.  Won't interrupt page rendering to execute
    3.  Executes in sequence just before the DOMContentLoaded event

    => defer is ideal for general JavaScript resources that aren't critical to the initial rendering of the page and can be run
    later in the loading process.

9.  What is `CORS`?

10. What is `CDN` and why do we use it ?

    A CDN is a Content Delivery Network – a global network of servers that work together to provide ultra-fast delivery of Internet
    content, such as web pages and streaming video.

When people try to access content via the Internet, a CDN makes sure they get it delivered from servers nearest to them, so it
arrives faster.

Simple example: Jane and Khalid both watch the latest viral video. Jane’s video is delivered from a data-center in San Francisco,
because that’s where she lives. Khalid’s video is delivered from a data-center in Singapore, because that’s where he is at the
moment.

We use `CDN` for following reasons:

1. Lower latency and faster performance.

2. Better security and DDoS protection.

3. Traditional web hosts are unable to keep up with the pace of change.

4. SEO advantage.

5. More affordable.

6. Reliable.

 **🎆 Difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM**


🌕 **Real DOM**

- DOM manipulation is very expensive
- There is too much memory wastage
- It updates Slow
- It can directly update HTML
- Creates a new DOM if the element updates.
- It allows us to directly target any specific node
  (HTML element)
- It represents the Ul of your application

🌕 **Virtual DOM**

- DOM manipulation is very easy
- No memory wastage
- It updates fast
- It can’t update HTML directly
- Update the JSX if the element update
- It can produce about ~200,000 Virtual DOM Nodes / Second.
- It is only a virtual representation of the DOM
