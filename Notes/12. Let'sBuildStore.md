1. `useContext vs Redux`.

- useContext is a hook while Redux is a state management library.
- useContext is used to share data while Redux is used to manage data and state.
- useContext is better to use for small applications & Redux for large applications.
- When using useContext it re-renders all components whenever there is any update in the provider’s value prop while in Redux it only re-render the updated components.
- By using useContext changes are made with the Context value and using Redux changes are made with pure functions i.e. reducers.

2. Advantages of using `Redux toolkit over Redux`.

- RTK gives the ability to write mutable state updates in the reducers.
- It also eliminates the use of extra coding by providing boilerplate.
- RTK also has the feature of RTK query which eliminates the use of Thunks and makes the query processing faster
- It also provides automatic support for Redux Dev-tools Extension and for immer.js library which is a great tool to deal with immutable objects.

3. Explain `Dispatcher`.

In react-redux the useDispatch hook gives us access to our store's dispatch method. Dispatch is used to send actions into our redux store and is the only way we can affect the store from within a component.

4. Explain `Reducer`.

In redux, the reducers are the pure functions that contain the logic and calculation that needed to be performed on the state. These functions accept the initial state of the state being used and the action type. It updates the state and responds with the new state. This updated state is sent back to the view components of the react to make the necessary changes.

```javascript
eg:
reducers : {
	action_name : (state,action) => {
		// code
	}
}
```

5. Explain `Slice`.

A Redux Slice is a collection of reducer logic and actions for a single feature of our app. The name “slice” comes from the idea that we’re splitting up the root Redux state object into multiple “slices” of slate.

6. Explain `createSlice` and the `javascript` it takes.

createSlice is a function that accepts an object of :

- Slice name
- Initial state value
- Reducers object that contains Reducer functions and its key names will be used to generate actions — these functions intended to handle a specific action type, equivalent to a single case statement in a switch — and each function has a state as the current value in the store and action that will carry the payload for the updated value.

```javascript
eg:
const sliceName = {
	name : NewSlice,
	initialState: {
		items :[],
	}
	reducers: {
		action_name : (state,action) => {
		// code
	}
  }
}
```

- To export the slice:
  - export default sliceName.reducer;
- To export the actions: 
  - export const {action_name1, action_name2} = sliceName.actions;

Now we need to provide the slice to configure the redux store. To do so we use `configureStore()`

```javascript
const appStore = configureStore({
      reducer: {
          slice: sliceName,
      },
});
```

 7. what is difference between below onClick function and which onclick when to use?

```javascript

onClick={()=>handleAddItem(item)}
onClick={handleAddItem(item)}
onClick={handleAddItem}

```

- do not do like this ever => onClick={handleAddItem(item)}

- `onClick={()=>handleAddItem(item)}` => when you need to pass additional arguments to the event handler function.
- `onClick={handleAddItem(item)}` => it invokes the function immediately during rendering and is incorrect for attaching event handlers.
- `onClick={handleAddItem}` => when you don't need to pass any additional arguments to the event handler. This is the clean and performant way to attach event handlers in most cases.


8. 

- `Store`:
  The store is the centralized data storage in a Redux application. It holds the global state of the application and provides a single source of truth. The state of the application is immutable, and changes can only be made through dispatched actions.

- `Dispatcher`:
  The dispatcher is a function provided by Redux that sends actions to the store. An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes an event that occurred in the application. The dispatcher is used to trigger these actions and update the state in the store accordingly.

  - Dispatching Actions:
    Components can dispatch actions using the useDispatch() hook provided by React-Redux. This hook gives you access to the dispatcher function. Actions can be defined using plain JavaScript objects or using action creator functions.

- `Reducer`:
  Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as input, and return a new state. They define how the application's state changes in response to dispatched actions. Each reducer typically handles a specific part of the application's state.

- `Provider`:
  The Provider is a React component provided by React-Redux that allows you to wrap your entire application with access to the Redux store. It ensures that components can access the state and dispatch actions from anywhere within the component tree without passing props explicitly.

- `Slice`:
  A slice is a part of the Redux store that defines the structure of the state and the associated reducers. It encapsulates the state and reducer logic related to a specific feature or domain in the application. Slices are typically defined using Redux Toolkit, a set of tools and conventions that simplify Redux development.

  - How to `configure slice`: createSlice is a function provide by rtk library that take some configuration object:
    1. name of the slice
    2. initial state of the slice which is a object
    3. reducer function which is a object that update the
    4. export reducer functions
    5. export default mainFunctionName.reducer;

- `Selector`:
  A selector is a function that computes derived data from the Redux store's state. It's used to extract specific pieces of data from the state in a memoized and efficient manner. Selectors help in avoiding unnecessary re-renders by ensuring that components only update when relevant parts of the state change.

  - Accessing State (Reading the state):
    Components can access the Redux store's state using the `useSelector()` hook provided by React-Redux. This hook takes a selector function as an argument and returns the selected data from the state.
