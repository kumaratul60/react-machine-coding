Summary of Differences

1. Action Definition:

   - Legacy Redux: Actions and action creators are manually defined.
   - Redux Toolkit: Actions are automatically generated by createSlice.

2. Reducer Definition:

   - Legacy Redux: Reducers are defined manually and handle action types.
   - Redux Toolkit: Reducers are defined in `createSlice`, and you modify state directly (using Immer under the hood).

3. Store Configuration:

   - Legacy Redux: Store is created manually with createStore and middleware needs to be configured manually.
   - Redux Toolkit: Store is created with configureStore, which automatically includes Redux Thunk and other common setups.

4. Component Connection:

   - Legacy Redux: Uses connect from react-redux to map state and dispatch to props.
   - Redux Toolkit: Uses useSelector and useDispatch hooks from react-redux, simplifying the component connection.

5. Error Handling and Caching:
   - Legacy Redux: Must be manually implemented in thunks and reducers.
   - Redux Toolkit: Automatically handles caching, re-fetching, and error states with RTK Query.
